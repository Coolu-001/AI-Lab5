Some weights of RobertaModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at FacebookAI/roberta-base and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
